# ChessNet
Java application for online chess

Currently on development phase. You can download the project and run it for example on Eclipse.
For testing the ChessNet, run one instance of 'ChessServer.java' and two instances of 'ChessClient.java'.

As soon as I have time, I will start running the ChessServer from my personal server, and also I will implement the ChessClient 
on some web page. 

Cheers,
Ossi
